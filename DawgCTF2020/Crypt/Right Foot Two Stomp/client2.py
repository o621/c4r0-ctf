Welcome to the AES-CBC oracle!
Our oracle's function is AES-CBC.
The oracle is found at umbccd.io:13372, and your methods are:
    flg - returns the encrypted flag
    enc - returns the encryption of the message after the : in "enc:..."
          as 16 bytes of initialization vector followed by the ciphertext.
    dec - returns the decryption of the ciphertext after the : in "dec:<16 bytes iv>..."
          as a bytes string.
