## Approach
output.png is [Hexahue](https://www.geocachingtoolbox.com/index.php?lang=en&page=hexahue) encoded file. So I try to make decode script.


## Solution
I made fuckin' decode script(hexahue_decoder.py).
Using this script and I got the flag.

>there is such as thing as a tomcat but have you ever heard of a tomdog. this is the most important question of our time, and unfortunately one that may never be answered by modern science. the definition of tomcat is a male cat, yet the name for a male dog is max. wait no. the name for a male dog is just dog. regardless, what would happen if we were to combine a male dog with a tomcat. perhaps wed end up with a dog that vomits out flags, like this one rtcp should,fl5g4,b3,st1cky,or,n0t


## Flag
```
rtcp{should,fl5g4,b3,st1cky,or,n0t}
```
