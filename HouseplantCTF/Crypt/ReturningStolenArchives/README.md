#  Returning Stolen Archives 

## Challenge
So I was trying to return the stolen archives securely, but it seems that I had to return them one at a time, and now it seems the thieves stole them back! Can you help recover them once and for all? It seems they had to steal them one at a time...

 Hint! Well you sure as hell ain't going to solve this one through factorization.

 returningstolenarchives.py 


## Approach
At first, I tried to decrypt ct but didn't work.
I came up with an idea that is compare the cipher text generated from alphabet with ct.

## Solution
I added some script to returningstolenarchives.py and that script worked!
