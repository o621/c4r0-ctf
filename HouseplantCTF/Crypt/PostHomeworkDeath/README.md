#  Post-Homework Death

## Challenge
My math teacher made me do this, so now I'm forcing you to do this too.

Flag is all lowercase; replace spaces with underscores.

## Approach
I found and referred to https://braingenie.ck12.org/skills/106542.



## Solution
I used https://keisan.casio.jp/exec/system/1308269580 and got *7 15 0 4 15 0 25 15 21 18 0 8 15 13 5 23 15 18 11 0 0*.
I know that number means A1Z26. So decode the number and then got the flag!
