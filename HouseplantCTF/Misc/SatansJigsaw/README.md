# Satan's Jigsaw

## Challenge
Oh no! I dropped my pixels on the floor and they're all muddled up! It's going to take me years to sort all 90,000 of these again :(

I was stuck with this...
My team member tell the filename means pixel info.

## Solution
I made the script using long_to_bytes method and got QR image.
